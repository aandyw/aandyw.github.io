In these past couple of months, I've had a lot of time to think about what the path of growth looks like for me. Slowing down and not having an exact plan of what I "should" do was initially unnerving, but I can safely say that things are working out. It's still a work in progress, and that's alright.

This isn't to say that the uncertainty doesn't get to me, and it's not to say that things are perfect. But I feel immensely grateful that I'm even on the right track.

In the book Atomic Habits, James Clear talks about focusing on systems and how a small shift now, plus long time horizons can drastically change the outcome of your future. This principle, along with [Roger Federer's speech at Dartmouth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqWUuYTcG-o&t=3s) has been the backbone of how I've been living my life. Pushing forward with resilience and focusing on the necessary systems at play, but also seeing the bigger picture of life.

There are many things I still have yet to work on that I want to work on. But the mental shift came from cutting through all the noise and focusing my efforts on the action.

# Action

To me, taking action means just doing something. A walk is better than no run. A step is better than no walk. Showing up is what counts. There will be ups and downs no matter what path you choose to walk. It's understanding that you don't always have to be running to improve. Happiness can come from just taking the next step.

Even still, action itself is a balancing act between **complacency** and **perfectionism** after having first picked a **priority**. It's not easy to *just* start and these are usually my reasons why.

### Complacency

There's no point in taking meaningless action. You should to things with intent and know thy goal for the corresponding action. Why are you doing this?


### Perfectionism

You shouldn't let yourself be caught up in a web of perfectionist thoughts. Most of the time, when you're starting out, things will never be perfect. It's impossible to envision the perfect answer before starting. Don't be paralyzed by perfection. Just shoot. Even if it might be your foot. At least you know it was wrong?

The first step is always the hardest.

### Priority

*It can be difficult to take action too when there are so many things you could do.*

How do you choose? Everything is so tempting and your eyes are often times bigger than your metaphorical stomach.

Tim Ferris has a couple of good questions that I think really helped:
1. What project / task, if done now, would make everything easier or unnecessary?
2. What project / task, if done, would make you the proudest?
3. What project / task, if done, even if it failed, would lead to the most successful outcomes (e.g. new skills, relationships, etc.)?

Not word for word, but the essence is captured.

## Okay, and?

When things get busy and your mind becomes cluttered. The best way forward is to pick a priority with the best information you have at the time and commit to action. There's uncertainty in everything you choose to do. Stop overthinking. Slow down. Aim your sights. And shoot.

Life is difficult. If it was easy, everyone would do it...oh wait..
