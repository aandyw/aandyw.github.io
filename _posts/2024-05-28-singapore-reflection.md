I had originally intended to write this entry while I was still abroad in Singapore. In fact, the previous
draft is right in front of me as I'm revising everything.

However, things have happened so fast one after another and before I knew it, I was already back in Canada.
I guess that's alright but it seems to be a continuing theme. My 4 months abroad went by in 
the blink of an eye and the only feelings I'm left with are the lingering feelings of wanting to go back.
To do more. To cherish again the camaraderie of exploring a foreign country with a close group of friends.

While my experience with studying abroad isn't something unexpected, I still feel plenty lucky to have
spent this past term surrounded by a cohort of people, whom I'm grateful to have become close with.

I've delayed this reflection long enough. As bittersweet as it is, I think it's about time I close this
chapter of my life. I'm still struggling to digest all these emotions even after a month, but it's a good
time to reflect. As the Dr. Seuss quote goes

> "Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened."

Let's have a good yap and I'll do my best to keep it short & sweet.

# Exchange In Singapore

### Leaving Home
I can still vividly recall the day I first received my acceptable letter to study in Singapore. That was truly of the only day's I can remember when I physically shot up into the air and screamed with joy. It might've been an overreaction but it was certainly a dream come true.

Fast forward a year, the start of 2024. After having a final celebration with family and friends for Christmas, I headed off to Asia to spend the New Years and beyond. First stop, Japan. **Tokyo** and **Kyoto** were the destinations. Then, it was off to the homeland (**China**) to reunite with relatives I haven't seen since Covid times.

I could yap on about the adventures I had all over but in the interest of your time and mine, I want to focus on the overall journey in Singapore. I might recall points from here and there and if that's the case, I'm sorry but it's my blog ;).

I can't lie. My first arrival in Singapore was both breathtaking and overwhelming. **Changi Aiport** truly was a jem but I was also plagued by countless worries about how the next 4 months would go. Like starting the first day of high school again, I wondered what I would do if I didn't like it here. I had also began to worry about my other committments as I student that I had brought along from back home. Yes, travel was fun, but how could I *TRULY* relax and enjoy my time when there was still work to be done? It helped that I had a mutual friend at the time in Singapore who was gracious enough to help me with getting settled down. If not for him, I certainly would've spent the first few days in Singapore completely in the dumps. So thank you dear friend.

In hindsight, I wish I could've told myself that things would work out just fine. There will always be more work. Enjoy the moment. Simple adages that if we all truly lived by would mean happiness for all. Alas, while I wholeheartedly wish I could go back in time and slap the living :shit: out of me, deep down I know I would've still done the same. In fact, I still struggle to live by these simple principles to this day! A definite character flaw :)

Hindsight really is 20/20.

### The First Day

I was filled with nerves the first day of orientation. Our host school had planned a couple of days of activities for the entire exchange group. Like I said, it really did feel like the first day of school. And like the first day of school, I arrived way too early. In fact, I was the first one in the room. I sat alone as the coordinators hurriedly finished final preparations for the orientation Anxiety, nervousness, and excitement weren't foreign feelings to me but at that moment, they sure were acting like it. However, once people began trickling in and I had a few conversations here and there, all my nerves just ... went away. It's shocking how fast you can lose yourself when engrossed in social interaction. Admist the bustling conversations, I can still recall saying to myself "these four months will go by in just a blink of an eye."

It was suffice to say, that the next few days of activities (which was just an amazing race equivalent but in Singapore) was nothing short of memorable.

### The Middle Part :)

Boom. Time Skip. The middle part. Also known as the chunky part. The part where you make all the memories. It's like a burger. You devoured the middle shit like there was no tomorrow and all that you're left with is wanting more. When you think back you wonder how you inhaled it so fast. It was certainly the best part. How did it just disappear?

...

No, is it just me? Unrelatable analogy? Ok.










### What the .. what do you mean it's the end. >:(

# My Honest Reaction
A friend of mine showed me this meme by [@tentenchan2525](https://twitter.com/tentenchan2525) on twitter. I think it really captures the essence of my 2024.
