An attempt to generate industry-standard facial images for anime characters using Generative Adversarial Networks. This project explores the application of GANs to create high-quality anime character faces with consistent style and quality.

## Features

- DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN) implementation
- Progressive GAN for high-resolution generation
- StyleGAN2 adaptation for anime faces
- Dataset preprocessing and augmentation
- Training pipeline with monitoring

## Model Architecture

- **Generator**: Deep convolutional network with batch normalization
- **Discriminator**: Convolutional classifier with spectral normalization
- **Loss Functions**: Wasserstein loss with gradient penalty
- **Training**: Progressive growing for resolution scaling

## Dataset

- Curated collection of anime character faces
- Preprocessed and aligned facial images
- Data augmentation techniques
- Quality filtering and validation

## Technologies Used

- PyTorch
- Python
- OpenCV for image processing
- TensorBoard for training visualization
