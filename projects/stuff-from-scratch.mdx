The birthplace of some really dubious AI/ML implementations. This project explores various machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch, including neural networks, decision trees, and clustering algorithms.

## Features

- Neural network implementation from scratch
- Decision tree classifier
- K-means clustering
- Linear and logistic regression
- Support vector machine implementation

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebooks
