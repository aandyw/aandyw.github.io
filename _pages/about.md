Hi there! I'm a final year student studying Mathematics and Computer Science at the [University of Waterloo]().

This portfolio was created to both showcase my ongoing [projects](/projects/) and [experiences](/cv/) while also giving me a space to track the things I've learned.
This could be through blog posts, project showcases, or something else. My goal is to "try" (heavy emphasis on try) to be consistent with publishing
something without needing it to be perfect.

Hopefully you didn't spend too long reading this...but if you're already here you might as well look around ツ

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
