This project is a general repository that hosts code for AI/ML topics that I explore and want to re-implement from
"scratch" for the fun of it. Its purpose is intended to be educational and to explore diverse but fundamental knowledge.

The project can be found on the github repo [StuffFromScratch](https://github.com/aandyw/StuffFromScratch).
